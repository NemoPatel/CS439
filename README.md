ðŸ“Š Effects of Weather on S&P 500 â€“ Data Science Project
This project investigates whether daily weather conditions in New York Cityâ€”such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speedâ€”have any measurable impact on the daily returns of the S&P 500 index. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), the analysis combines financial data with meteorological data to explore statistical correlations and train machine learning models.

Key Features:
Data merged from Yahoo Finance and Meteostat APIs (2019â€“2024)

Feature engineering (e.g., daily returns, volatility, weather bins)

Supervised learning models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree

Exploratory data visualizations and statistical analysis

Evaluation using RÂ², MSE, and interpretive visuals

Conclusion:
The results show no meaningful correlation between NYC weather and S&P 500 returns, reinforcing the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
